## Image Classification based on the contextual data of the image. firstly we applied several data preprocessing and data augmentation.
## For example: cropping the cars using it’s boundary boxes then applying many data augmentation techniques: Flipping with Fixed degrees ## Noise addition and Applying Grayscale to the images.
## After that we used only tflearn API to train differents models: using GoogleNet architecture and Pre-Trained VGG16 Model.
